msgid "It is common to find problems with graphs that have not been constructed fully noded or in graphs with zlevels at intersection that have been entered incorrectly. An other problem is oneway streets that have been entered in the wrong direction. We can not detect errors with respect to \"ground\" truth, but we can look for inconsistencies and some anomalies in a graph and report them for additional inspections."
