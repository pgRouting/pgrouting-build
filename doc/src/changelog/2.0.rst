pgRouting 2.0 Release Notes
===============================================================================

With the release of pgRouting 2.0 the library has abandoned backwards compatibility to :ref:`pgRouting 1.x <changelog_1_x>` releases. We did this so we could restructure pgRouting, standardize the function naming, and prepare the project for future development. As a result of this effort, we have been able to simplify pgRouting, add significant new functionality, integrate documentation and testing into the source tree and make it easier for multiple developers to make contribution.

For important changes see the following release notes. To see the full list of changes check the list of `Git commits <https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/commits>`_ on Github.
